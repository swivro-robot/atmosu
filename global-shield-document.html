Global Shield will eventually expand beyond ICBM defense to offer other civil defense services, so it can defend humanity against any and all major threats. If Atmos’ Prosperity Union Proposal (<a href="prosperity-union.html" class="text-primary">https://atmosu.com/prosperity-union</a>) succeeds, to unite humanity as one, against hostile forces from outside of humanity, Global Shield would (likely) become the defense division of Prosperity Union. However, for now, Global Shield will focus primarily on defense against nuclear weapons (primarily nuclear-armed ICBMs).
<br>The ICBM defense focus of Global Shield involves a network of missile interceptors around the planets of Earth and Mars (where humanity will be primarily based by 2030). These missile interceptors would be placed in countries which possess trustworthy governments in this aspect. Atmos would be the organization to determine which countries have “trustworthy” governments which are willing to work with us. Some possible ones include the government of Japan, Korea, and others. However, no final decisions have been made at all, these are just example names. Global Shield’s network of ICBM interceptors would have three levels (three different kinds of interceptors). The Level-1 Global Shield Interceptor would be dedicated to intercepting ICBMs at their initial launch (boost) phase. The Level-2 Global Shield Interceptor would be dedicated to intercepting ICBMs at their midcourse (coasting) phase, in space. The Level-3 Interceptors would be dedicated to intercepting ICBMs during their descent (terminal) phase. A more detailed description of each interceptor type can be seen below.</strong></div><strong><br></strong><div><strong><u>ICBM Interceptor Variants<br>The Level-1 variant</u> of high-speed Global Shield ICBM Interceptors is designed to intercept a nuclear-armed ICBM during its boost phase. This is the earliest phase of an ICBM's flight, during which it is still ascending into space. Level-1 interceptor missiles are launched from a ground-based launcher and are designed to destroy the ICBM before it can release any of its nuclear payloads (nuclear warheads), or even reach space, making it the (potentially) most desirable scenario.
</strong></div><div><strong>Unlike the Level-2 and Level-3 interceptors, Level-1 interceptors do not utilize a (multiple-)kill vehicle system. Instead, they largely rely on traditional missile intercept technology to destroy the ICBM (basically, smash into and destroy the ICBM at a very high velocity). The probability of a successful ICBM interception via Global Shield is much higher when a Level-1 missile interceptor is launched, due to the slow speed and larger size (relative to its surroundings) of the ICBM during its boost phase, making it a much easier target to neutralize.
</strong></div><div><strong>Additionally, specially-designed hypersonic missiles can be deployed by fighter jets or UAVs (preferably UAVs) to neutralize the ICBM in its boost phase while it's still at a relatively low altitude and velocity. Hypersonic missiles are exceedingly unlikely to be intercepted by a hostile force, as they are far too fast and maneuverable to track. Factor in that we can launch dozens of hypersonic missiles at once, and the chances of success are increased substantially. But when the time comes where the capability to intercept hypersonic missiles is normalized, we will move to new, more advanced technologies, not that we aren't already working on such technologies.</strong></div><div><strong>If a Level-1 Global Shield ICBM Interceptor is launched, <u>it would intercept the target ICBM in under 5 minutes</u>.<br><br></strong></div><div><strong><u>The Level-2 variant</u> of high-speed Global Shield ICBM Interceptors is designed to intercept a nuclear-armed ICBM during its midcourse phase. This is when the ICBM has reached what is considered to be outer space and is traveling towards its target. Level-2 high-speed Global Shield interceptors would be launched from a launch site in a country that utilizes Atmos Global Shield towards the ICBM to neutralize it before it reaches its target.<br>Level-2 interceptors use a kill vehicle system, which can deploy multiple kill vehicles (smaller crafts capable of maneuvering with extreme precision and accuracy) to intercept and destroy the ICBM. This provides a much higher probability of successful interception compared to, for example, a single kill vehicle, or even an ICBM interceptor without any kill vehicle system. If the ICBM deploys countermeasures to evade destruction by an interceptor, additional interceptors may be launched, or, any remaining kill vehicles will attempt to intercept.</strong></div><div><strong>If a Level-2 Global Shield ICBM Interceptor is launched, <u>it would intercept the target ICBM in under 30 minutes.</u></strong></div><strong><br></strong><div><strong><u>The Level-3 variant</u> of high-speed Global Shield ICBM Interceptors is the final defense against a nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile. It attempts to intercept the missile during its terminal phase when it re-enters the atmosphere and plummets towards its target at high speed. This is considered the most challenging time to intercept an ICBM and is the last opportunity to do so. Launched from the ground with high precision, Level-3 interceptors aim to successfully intercept an ICBM within ~30 seconds before the ICBM's planned detonation.<br>Level-3 interceptors also utilize a kill vehicle system, which can deploy multiple high-precision kill vehicles to intercept and destroy the ICBM. The probability of a successful interception is significantly increased by utilizing a multi-kill-vehicle system on a single ICBM interceptor and multiple interceptor launches, making the possibility of failure very low.
</strong></div><div><strong>If a Level-3 Global Shield ICBM Interceptor is launched, <u>it would intercept the target ICBM in under 1 minute.</u></strong></div><strong><br></strong><div><strong><u>ICBM Defense Kill Vehicle Functionality<br></u>The Kill Vehicle, which is the vehicle deployed from the ICBM interceptor rocket body, is the vehicle that actually does the work to destroy the target ICBM. It is a smaller craft deployed from the nose cone/payload fairing of an ICBM interceptor which is smaller in size. It features numerous high-precision thrusters utilizing hypergolic propellants for thrust, and other high-precision systems. The Kill Vehicle performs as efficiently and as precisely and accurately as physically possible. The United States Navy of the US Military has proven that kill vehicles have capability of destroying target ICBMs, as demonstrated by the Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IIA missile interceptor’s kill vehicle on Nov. 16, 2020, where the US intercepted an ICBM launched from the Kwajalein Atoll. Atmos’ Global Shield ICBM interceptors would utilize a multi kill vehicle (MKV) system to ensure success, reliability, and redundancy. Lockheed Martin began working on a multi kill vehicle system many years ago, but they have halted the program (as far as we know) and are no longer working on such a project. We believe a multi kill vehicle system is vital to ensure that we can successfully down a nuclear missile to avoid tragedy. The people in power of the world today do not understand the power of nuclear power, they underestimate it greatly and don’t realize how big of an issue it could be. If Russia were to launch all of their nuclear weapons at the same time at the United States (assuming it would be possible), or the US were to launch all of their nuclear weapons at, say, South Korea, none of these countries would have any defense against it. The whole world can be turned into ash. That should change, because a nuclear war, especially a global one, has no winners. Global Shield is not developed specifically for the government of any country, it is developed for humanity, to protect humanity from the danger of nuclear catastrophe. This is philanthropy.</strong></div><div><strong><br><u>ICBM Defense Interceptor Rocket
</u></strong></div><div><strong>The actual launch vehicle of the ICBM interceptor which propels the kill vehicle in order for it to be utilized, typically consists of two stages, but it can vary depending on which level ICBM interceptor is used. Atmos, for various reasons, chooses to not publish highly-specific technical details, though the ICBM interceptor launch vehicle would utilize solid fuel and liquid fuel. This includes ammonium perchlorate (solid oxidizer) and atomized aluminum powder (solid fuel), collectively referred to as solid propellant. This is the same type of propellant that NASA’s space shuttle solid rocket side boosters utilized. In addition to this solid propellant on the first stage of the interceptor rocket, the second stage would utilize liquid hypergolic propellant (Dinitrogen Tetroxide as oxidizer and Monomethylhydrazine as fuel). A hypergolic propellant is a propellant consisting of a fuel and oxidizer which combust immediately upon contact. This type of hypergolic propellant can also be stored at room temperature. This makes it ideal for the quick deployment of an ICBM interceptor, as there is, unlike traditional rocket propellants, no need to cool down any fuel or oxidizer, and there is no need for a separate ignition system to trigger combustion once propellant starts flowing through the fuel/ox injectors of the rocket engine into the combustion chamber. These features of hypergolic propellant significantly decrease the risk of something going wrong with the ICBM interceptor launch. The less parts you have, the less risk of failure you have. Another way to put it is “The best part is no part”, as said by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. These interceptors would typically be launched from a missile silo on land, but could also be launched from designated areas in the sea and from warships of the militaries of select nations.</strong></div><strong><br></strong><div><strong><u>Tracking and detecting ICBMs</u></strong></div><div><strong>To detect, track, and monitor a nuclear-armed ICBM, different techniques are used at different stages of its flight. In the boost phase, when the ICBM is launched from the ground, Early Warning Radars and Infrared Sensors on the ground and in space can locate and follow the missile. In the midcourse phase, when the ICBM travels through space, the same techniques can be used, along with optical sensors and other systems that can detect the heat signature of the missile. In the terminal phase, when the ICBM re-enters the atmosphere, all of these techniques can be applied, as well as Electro-Optical sensors that can detect electromagnetic radiation in the visible, infrared, and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum. The nuclear warhead itself emits a lot of infrared radiation, making it easier for electro-optical sensors to spot it. To accurately track the position of an ICBM and eliminate a nuclear threat, all of these methods can be combined with some other precise methods.</strong></div><strong><br></strong><div><strong><u>Avoiding Countermeasures</u></strong></div><div><strong>The adversary who launches the ICBM would likely oppose our attempt to intercept their ICBM, and they would employ various countermeasures to prevent us. That includes targeting our space-based assets (satellites) and ground-based assets, among others. To mitigate this, Atmos would collaborate with governments to establish, essentially, such a large number of ground stations on Earth and such a large number of satellites, that it would almost be considered excessively large number of ground stations and space-based tracking stations. This is essential for redundancy. We would prefer it so even in the event of 70% of all our ground-based assets and 70% of our space-based assets being completely destroyed in an attack, we would still be able to accurately track over 13,000 nuclear warheads (the amount the world currently has, as of 2023), to ultimately intercept and destroy them all, preventing any nuclear catastrophe from taking place. Simply, we want to create so many ground stations and space-based tracking stations, that, even if every single nuclear-armed ICBM in the world were launched, it would be impossible for the adversary to destroy all of our ground-based and space-based tracking systems to prevent us from intercepting the ICBMs.</strong></div><div><strong>Additionally, to decrease the likelihood of any of our ground tracking stations being destroyed in an attack, each station would feature missile defense systems (which we will discuss more in depth later). These ground-station missile defense systems, in order to intercept short-to-medium-range non-nuclear ballistic missiles targeting our ground tracking stations, would use systems similar to the United States Military's C-RAM and Israel's Iron Dome, which either utilize kinetic energy projectiles (essentially bullets) or missile interceptors to create a shrapnel cloud which will severely damage or destroy the incoming projectile. We would also attempt to, using standard Global Shield missile interceptors, intercept all non-nuclear missiles which are headed towards our tracking satellites, assuming these missiles have an intent of destroying our satellite infrastructure. For this scenario, standard Global Shield interception missiles (Level-2) would be utilized.</strong></div><div><strong>Factoring in all of our efforts to ensure our success in intercepting a nuclear-armed ICBM and missiles targeting Atmos infrastructure, our chances of successful interception of every single nuclear-armed ICBM in the world (if all launched at once somehow) are greatly increased.</strong></div><div>
</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong><u>100 Launch Plan
</u></strong></div><div><strong>The Atmos Corporation has a short-term goal to collect and reserve sufficient funds to launch 100 dummy Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) and 600 interceptors with kill vehicles for the purpose of intercepting these dummy ICBMs to test their reliability, efficiency, effectiveness and precision. During this test campaign, Atmos will use its inventory of dummy ICBMs and test interceptors to attempt interception at various points in the boost phase, midcourse phase and terminal phase. If complete success is not achieved in this test campaign, another round of testing involving an additional 100 dummy ICBMs and 600 interceptors will be conducted. Upon successful completion of the second test campaign and assuming sufficient funds were collected, the Global Shield project will become operational.</strong></div><div>
